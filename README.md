This project use Vite + React and Node.js

Coding will be done in "\Coding\Hospital_System\src"

Create components and route them through App.jsx

Components will be stored in the components folder

Back end file will be stored in the back-end folder

For back-end we will create the x.route.js and import db from index.js to access mysql

Remember to modify the host, user, password and database of db in index.js to match what you set in your computer MySQL. You can just remove the procees.env and use your informatoin directly

In the x.route.js we will create a router and then do get/post/put/delete on this. We will "export default router" and import the router in server.js

You can watch the code that I do to visualize the process. I'm not sure my way is efficient so if you have a better way you can do it.
