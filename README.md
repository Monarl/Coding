This project use Vite + React and Node.js

Coding will be done in "\Coding\Hospital_System\src"

Create components and route them through App.jsx

Components will be stored in the components folder

Back end file will be stored in the back-end folder

For back-end we will create the x.route.js and import db from index.js to access mysql

In the x.route.js we will create a router and then do get/post/put/delete on this. We will "export default router" and import the router in server.js

You can watch the code that I do to visualize the process. I'm not sure my way is efficient so if you have a better way you can do it.
